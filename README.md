## sdstatus

This is a PoC tool to check the status of [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org) instances.

All the addresses are mentioned in the `sdonion.txt` file, one address each line.
I have a copy of the addresses from the SecureDrop [directory](https://securedrop.org/directory)
to test.


## System requirement

The tool assumes that Tor is running with a SOCKS proxy at port 9050 in the system.

The dependencies are managed using [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/) tool.


## How to build?

Checkout the git repo in your `$GOPATH`, and then simple `go build` will do the work
for you.



## Output format

```
[
	{
		"Info": {
			"sd_version": "0.6",
			"gpg_fpr": "3392A1CE68FE779A95FCAF04EDA0FB6F53FA9093"
		},
		"Url": "m4hynbhhctdk27jr.onion",
		"Available": true
	},
	{
		"Info": {
			"sd_version": "0.6",
			"gpg_fpr": "7C24A77EED0D50838E3315BD7A38590B2996F0C2"
		},
		"Url": "ftugftwajmgsmoau.onion",
		"Available": true
	}
]
```

Currently by default the tool prints JSON output on the STDOUT. It is a list of dictionaries telling if the site is available, and
the SecureDrop version and also the journalist GPG key fingerprint.

If you pass `--csv` flag to the tool, then it will print output in CSV format. First the Onion address, then SecureDrop version,
and then the journalist GPG key fingerprint. If only the Onion address is printed along with `,,`, it means those
instances could not be reached (maybe they down).
